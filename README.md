In this task, I worked with the Titanic dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived or not. I began by loading and inspecting the data to understand its structure and identify missing values. To clean the data, I filled in missing 'Age' values with the median and missing 'Embarked' values with the most frequent port. Since the 'Cabin' column had too many missing entries, I decided to drop it. I then performed feature engineering, converting categorical variables like 'Sex' and 'Embarked' into numerical values using mapping and one-hot encoding. For exploratory data analysis (EDA), I visualized survival counts, survival by gender, age and fare distributions, and survival rates by passenger class, helping me understand the relationships between features. After preparing the data, I split it into training and testing sets, using 80% for training and 20% for testing. I chose a Random Forest Classifier to train the model and then made predictions on the test set. To evaluate the model's performance, I calculated accuracy and reviewed the confusion matrix and classification report. This task allowed me to practice data cleaning, feature engineering, and model evaluation, giving me a hands-on understanding of the machine learning workflow.
